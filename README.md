## 3. DESCRIPTION
- This is a Syntax Checker
- How to use:
  1. Open terminal
  2. Change into the directory containing source files
  3. Type "make all" into your command line
  4. Type "./assignment3.out" into your command line
  5. Follow the menu prompts
- Important Notes:
  - The syntax checker will store opening delimiters, then look for the first closing delimiter.
  - If the next closing delimiter doesn't match the last stored opening delimiter,
  then the checker will provide the line of the expected matching closing delimiter.
